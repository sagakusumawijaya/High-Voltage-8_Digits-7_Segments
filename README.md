# High-Voltage-8_Digits-7_Segments (On-Progress)
Applying 8-Digits High Voltage 7-Segments 

## Schematic
You can see the schematic in pdf format [here](https://github.com/sagakusumawijaya/High-Voltage-8_Digits-7_Segments/blob/master/Schematic%20-%20High%20Voltage%208%20Digit%20Seven%20Segment.pdf). If you want to make or order a pcb, just download the gerber file [here](https://github.com/sagakusumawijaya/High-Voltage-8_Digits-7_Segments/blob/master/Gerber_High%20Voltage%208%20Digit%20Seven%20Segment_20200204073423.zip). 
I'm using EasyEDA and order the pcb at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/). Images of the pcb shown below.
